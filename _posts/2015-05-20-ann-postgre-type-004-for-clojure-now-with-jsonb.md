Thanks to [yogthos](http://yogthos.net/) I have updated my library [postgres-type](https://github.com/siscia/postgres-type).

The library is extremely simple but let you use postgres with the JSON data type and now also with JSONB.

JSONB(inary) save your JSON data structure directly into a binary format, it is faster than the regular JSON for most use cases.

If you need some particular datatype implemented in the library please either make a pull request or at least open an issue.
