I just [released a simple grammar](https://github.com/siscia/css-grammar) that I wrote using instaparse.

The grammar parse the basic CSS types.

CSS types are a very strange beast and I did my best to make the parser flexible and correct, but it is hard.

The next obvious step is to parse the whole CSS.

If you use the grammar and find any mistake please let me know.

The overall experience using instaparse was extremely positive and I am looking forward to keep using it.

If you want to help in the developing of the project please get in touch.
